title: Meltytech acquires copyrights from Ushodaya
category: blog
---

Ushodaya Enterprises Limited of India, the original sponsor of the MLT and Melted
projects has <a href="/assets/Assignment-Dan%20Dennedy-%20MLT%20-%20Oct14.pdf">assigned their copyrights</a> to Daniel R. Dennedy, sole proprietor and CTO of <a href="http://www.meltytech.com/">Meltytech, LLC</a>. What does that mean? Not much. There are no planned changes to project direction at this time, but it may provide some options in the future. It is just good to have the copyrights under control of active members of the project to make it possible to exercise future options. Many thanks to project co-founder, BGa, for facilitating this transaction.
